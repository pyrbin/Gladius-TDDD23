### Combo System:
Every weapon will have a 3 hit combo. If you successfully hit a target (doesn't have to be the same) 3 times the fourth attack will be more powerful. 

Examples:
* Shortsword: Larger swing
* Greatsword: Lunge stab
* Hammer: Big smash
* Spear: Jump impale
* Dagger: Jump impale
* Ranged: Double shot

### Armor System:
Equipment in the game can give <i>Defense/Deflect/Armor</i> +X which will grant the unit X armor points. All damage will be mitigated if the unit has an active armor point. To remove armor you either have to succesfully land a combo (the 4th attack) or <b>Bash/Parry*</b> the unit while it's using it's weapon. When all armor points has been broken the unit can be attacked. Note: armor will not block effects such as bleeding, knockback, burning however will block those effects if they're are applied by a weapon.

### Bash/Parry System:
Requires energy. Charge towards the mouse position. If an enemy is hit apply knockback and remove an armor point if the enemy is using its weapon.
