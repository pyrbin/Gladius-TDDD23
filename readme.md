# Gladius (temporary) - TDDD23

## Game Idea
Gladius is a single-player top-down action roguelike where the player plays a gladiator. The setting is fictional ancient Rome and the goal of the game is
to end victorious in a chain of arenas to finally reach Rome where the final boss resides. The arenas are procedurally/randomly generated (however as time is scarce I may design a couple of arenas and just choose at random). In the arenas opponens will come in waves and there will be different traps such as spike traps that has to be avoided or used to your advantage. The player will earn gold & fame after each arena that can be used to buy items such as weapons or armor before the next arena.

The major focus and scope of the game is to create a meaningful combat system that will play similarly to games such as "Nuclear Throne" and "Enter the Gungeon", however more focused on melee combat and different melee weapon types.

My current scope is to create:

* Weapons
    * 2 x Swing weapons (swords, longswords) <b>✓done</b>
    * 2 x Stab weapons (spear, dagger)
    * 1 x Ranged weapons (crossbow)
* Health & stamina system <b>✓done</b>
* Player jump & walk animations <b>✓done</b>
* Inventory system
* Shop system
* Items
    * 4 x Helmets
    * 4 x Chestpieces
    * 4 x Leggings
* Enemies
    * Enemy gladiators
    * Lions
    * One boss
* Traps
    * Spike trap
    * Lion trap (chained lion)
* Arenas
    * 4 x Different layouts 
    * 1 x Boss layout (Rome)


## Game Tech
The technologies used are:

* Godot 3.0
* Pyxel Edit (pixel graphics)
* Photoshop 
* FL Studio (sound)

## Progression in the Game
The game's progression will  act as a typical roguelike where the player starts with nothing and has to progress different levels (arenas) to get better and get random loot. The player will progressively get stronger by loot however the arenas will aswell. The game experience will vary depending on the focus of your character each run (will you focus on melee swing weapons like swords or ranged weapons like a bow) and the different arenas. If they player dies they lose everything and has to restart.

## In-game feedback and visuals for teaching the game
The game will be very self explanatory as the goal is simply to defeat the enemies that are thrown at you. The controls will be shown in an easy format. The games biggest focus will be the combat and therefore its important the combat has good feedback. This will be accomplished by clear visuals and different techniques such as screenshakes, knockbacks and good sound to make weapon swings to feel impactful and to easily notice if they were connected to the enemy. As the different runs will be fast the player will quickly learn how to evade and dodge different mechanics by repetition.
